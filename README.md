Things to do: 
1. (DONE) To Do List database not refreshing properly. When item is deleted, not instantly reflected on UI but is reflected in database.
2. Add camera functionality to notes app. Allow users to add pictures into notes.
3. (DONE - MOSTLY) Add one sensor functionality. I want to add a "shake to delete" function when user is editing or creating a new note. They shake to clear all text on screen. BUG: When you shake to delete while adding a new note, deletes all existing notes. Don't know why. 
4. Add user settings (shared preferences). Allow user to change font size, color and style from 'Settings' option in home screen.
